In this stage, we designed and implemented a web-based user interface for the sports celebrity image classification project. The UI enables users to upload an image, submit it for prediction, and view classification results in a clean and interactive format. The backend connects to the trained ML model via a Python Flask server, delivering real-time identification of the five target sports celebrities.

## Key Features
- User-friendly website for image upload
- Frontend communicates with Flask server for predictions
- Displays classification output visually and clearly
- Provides a foundation for deploying the model as a real-world application

## Steps Covered
1. Develop web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. Integrate template with Flask server endpoints
3. Handle image input, show results dynamically
4. Test workflow end-to-end with real sample images

## Outcome
Successfully built and tested a fully functional web app for sports celebrity image recognition, making the project accessible and interactive for non-technical users.
