## Model Training and Selection

The notebook [`notebooks/02_train_model.ipynb`] covers:
- Training the classifier with cropped and wavelet-transformed images
- Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearch on multiple models (SVM, RandomForest, etc.)
- Selection and saving of the best-performing model
- Step-by-step annotated code for reproducibility
